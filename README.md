## Background 

Earlier this year, I was hired as the Data Specialist for [Circle of Care](https://www.circleofcare.com/), a not-for-profit home care provider service for elderly individuals in the Greater Toronto Area. I was tasked with making sense of years of data within the organization, while decreasing manual labor needed to access said data. Prior to my arrival at the organization, there were established KPIs reported weekly, annually, and quarterly, in the form of color coded Excel documents, and I was asked to turn a manual labor heavy process into a more efficient one. 

Three months before my arrival, the organization began to use a scheduling algorithm to create the schedules of support workers in their three month probation period. There was no manner of tracking the progress/efficacy of the scheduling, and I was asked to create an evaluation of the algorithm's scheduling ability.

Currently the tidy data files used to create the dashboards are Excel Workbooks derived from the initial workbooks sent out by the organization prior to my arrival. Over the next few months, various department members and I will work to transition into an SQL database (MS Access) within the network drive. 


## Objectives 
- Document existing KPIs (monitored in the form of a "Heat Map" excel file) 
- Assess PSW scheduling to determine if 80% of worker hours are being met (Scheduling algorithm evaluation)
- Summarize organization's social media activity (Communications)
- Track offer rejections and risk events throughout the organization
