## Background 

Earlier this year, I was hired as the Data Specialist for [Circle of Care](https://www.circleofcare.com/), a not-for-profit home care provider service for elderly individuals in the Greater Toronto Area. I was tasked with making sense of years of data within the organization, while decreasing manual labor needed to access said data. Prior to my arrival at the organization, there were established KPIs reported weekly, annually, and quarterly, in the form of color coded Excel documents, and I was asked to turn a manual labor heavy process into a more efficient one. 

Three months before my arrival, the organization began to use a scheduling algorithm to create the schedules of support workers in their three month probation period. There was no manner of tracking the progress/efficacy of the scheduling, and I was asked to create an evaluation of the algorithm's scheduling ability.

As the data used in the dashboard is not sensitive/private, our current solution for live data is to upload entries onto a Google Sheet. This option has been selected as it is most accessible to members of the organization, and requires the least amount of training due to its similarity to Microsoft Excel. As the organization's needs change, the manner of storage will be adjusted accordingly.  


## Objectives 
- Document existing KPIs (monitored in the form of a "Heat Map" excel file) 
- Assess PSW scheduling to determine if 80% of worker hours are being met (Scheduling algorithm evaluation)
- Summarize organization's social media activity (Communications)
- Track offer rejections and risk events throughout the organization
